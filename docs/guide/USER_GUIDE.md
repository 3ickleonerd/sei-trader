## 🎯 Trading with AI Assistance

### Natural Language Trading

Sei Trader understands natural language! You can ask questions like:

**Market Analysis:**
- "What's the best crypto to trade right now?"
- "Should I buy WSEI today?"
- "How is WBTC performing this week?"

**Specific Trades:**
- "I want to buy WSEI, what's a good entry point?"
- "Should I sell my WETH position?"
- "Compare WSEI vs WBTC for swing trading"

**Risk Assessment:**
- "What are the risks of trading iSEI?"
- "Is now a good time to enter the market?"
- "How volatile is SEIYAN?"

### AI Analysis Example

```
📊 AI Analysis: WSEI

Current Price: $0.42
24h Change: +5.2%

🎯 Trading Recommendation:
Entry Point: $0.40 - $0.42
Stop Loss: $0.38 (-10%)
Take Profit: $0.48 (+15%)

💭 AI Reasoning:
WSEI shows bullish momentum with strong volume 
increase. Recent support at $0.38 provides good 
risk/reward ratio. Consider 2-3% position size.
